# Deployment Setup Guide üöÄ

This guide walks you through setting up a deployment pipeline using Jenkins for deploying your web application to **PP (Pre-Production)** and **PROD (Production)** environments with AWS services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Process Overview

1. **Deploy to PP** ‚Äì Deploys the app to the PP server and switches traffic to PP.  
2. **Deploy to PROD** ‚Äì Deploys the code to the PROD server only.  
3. **Create AMI & Launch Template** ‚Äì Creates a new AMI, launch template, and updates ASG with new instances. Then switches traffic.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

- **Jenkins** with 3 Deployment jobs (one for each step).
- **AWS CLI** installed on Jenkins server.
- **AWS Access Keys** with full admin rights (CLI access required).
- **Environment Variables** configured in Jenkins.

### Mandatory Variables to Set
- **DEPLOYMENT_TAG**: Deployment version/tag (important for all jobs).  
- **GIT_USERNAME**: Your GitHub username.  
- **GIT_VALID_TOKEN**: GitHub personal access token (with required permissions).  
- **AMI_NAME**: AMI name to be created.  
- **AMI_DESCRIPTION**: Description for the AMI.  
- **EC2_USER**: SSH username for EC2 instances.  
- **PP_INSTANCE_ID**: PP server instance ID.  
- **PROD_INSTANCE_ID**: PROD server instance ID.  
- **LAUNCH_TEMPLATE_ID**: Launch Template ID for EC2.  
- **ASG_NAME**: Auto Scaling Group (ASG) name.  
- **ALB_LISTENER_ARN**: ARN for the ALB listener.  
- **PP_TG_ARN**: ARN for the PP target group.  
- **PROD_TG_ARN**: ARN for the PROD target group.

## üîÑ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: **Deploy to PP** (Job 1)

1. **Start PP Server Instance**: Initiates the PP server for deployment.  
2. **Wait for PP Instance to Pass Checks**: Waits until the PP server is healthy.  
3. **Deploy Code to PP Server**: Deploys your app code from GitHub to the PP server via SSH.  
4. **Health Check**: Verifies PP server is healthy in the target group.  
5. **Balance Traffic**: Switches traffic between PP and PROD instances via the ALB listener.

### Step 2: **Deploy to PROD** (Job 2)

1. **Deploy Code to PROD**: Deploys code to the PROD server.  
2. **Health Check**: Verifies the health status of the PROD server.  
3. **Validate Application**: Ensures the app is working after deployment.

### Step 3: **Create AMI & Update ASG** (Job 3)

1. **Create New AMI**: Creates a new AMI from the PROD instance.  
2. **Update Launch Template**: Updates the Launch Template with the new AMI.  
3. **Update ASG**: Terminates old instances and launches new ones with the updated AMI.  
4. **Switch Traffic**: Modifies the ALB listener to shift traffic as needed.

### Step 4: **Stop PP Instance**:  
Stops the PP instance after successful deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Configure Jenkins Jobs

1. **Create 3 Jenkins Jobs**:  
   - **deploy-1**: Deploys to PP and switches traffic.  
   - **deploy-2**: Deploys to PROD.  
   - **deploy-3**: Creates AMI, updates launch template, and updates ASG.

2. **Install AWS CLI on Jenkins Server**:  
   - Ensure AWS CLI is configured on the Jenkins server using `aws configure` with your AWS Access Keys.  
   - Required access: **Full Admin Rights** (CLI access only).

3. **Update Variables**:  
   - Set the environment variables as described above before running the deployment jobs.  
   - Make sure **DEPLOYMENT_TAG** is updated in each Jenkins job.

## üéØ Conclusion

This guide provides a simple yet detailed process to deploy your web application to **PP** and **PROD** environments using AWS and Jenkins. Ensure that your environment variables are correctly configured, and follow the steps for each deployment job to achieve successful deployments.
